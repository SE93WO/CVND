My solutions to the projects assigned for the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree

Project | Concepts | Tools 
--- | --- | ---
[Facial Keypoints](CVND/Project/Facial_Keypoint_Detection) | Face Detection, Haar Cascades, CNNs, keypoints | OpenCV, pytorch
[Image Captioning](CVND/Project/Image_Captioning) |  COCO dataset, transfer learning, EncoderCNN/DecoderRNN, LSTMs, feature vectors, word embeddings | pytorch, torchvision, nltk
[LandMark Detection And Tracking](CVND/Project/LandMark_Detection_And_Tracking) | Offline SLAM, Online SLAM  | numpy, pandas, seaborn

Further explorations of computer vision related topics, such as image segmentation, detection of corners, edges, and contours, k-means clustering, ORB and HOG feature vectors, CNNs, and YOLO, can be found in the [Exercises](CVND/Exercises) folder.
